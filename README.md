# This is my Portfolio

NOTE:
1. This also includes several projects as it generally works as a website handlers, handling all requests and handling each request depending on the link you're requesting on.
so dev-adly.tk/url-shortener redirects you to the url-shortener project i made a while ago.

2. All of these projects are 1 year old since i wrote this readme.

3. This project lacks the node_modules folder as it is fully coded in Node.js

4. All directories prefixed with "--" in the "websites/" directory are disabled but the code still works fine.
