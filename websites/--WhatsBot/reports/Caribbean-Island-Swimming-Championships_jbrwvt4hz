The Caribbean Islands Swimming Championships (CISCs) is a biennial aquatics championships held in even years. They are organized by CCCAN and feature age-group competition for teams from Caribbean island nations. They have been held since 1976, and feature competition in 5 of FINA's Aquatics disciplines: swimming, open water, diving, water polo, and synchronized swimming. 


== Participating Countries ==
The CISCs predominantly features teams from the Caribbean, but traditionally also includes Guyana and Suriname, members of CONSANAT--South America's Swimming Confederation. 
Twenty (21) countries have been invited to the 2016 Championships:

Residents of the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique have also been invited to compete, despite the fact that they technically fall under the jurisdiction of the French Swimming Federation and therefore are considered part of Europe (but geographically are in the Caribbean). Likewise, swimmers from Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius (part of the Netherlands), and Saint Martin are also invited.
